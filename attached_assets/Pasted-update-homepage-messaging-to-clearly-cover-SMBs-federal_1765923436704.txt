Section: “What We Automate”

Use cards or bullets:

Common workflows we automate include:

• Lead qualification & routing
Website, forms, or emails → AI qualification → CRM updates → follow-up actions

• Client intake & summarization
Forms, documents, or emails → structured summaries → next-step recommendations

• Support & service ticket triage
Categorization, prioritization, response drafting, and escalation logic

• Compliance & policy checks
Policy-aware review, risk flagging, bias detection, and audit-ready outputs

• Internal knowledge assistants
Secure AI trained on private documents for accurate, role-aware answers

• Operational reporting & insights
Activity data → AI-generated insights → dashboards and decision support

…and other custom AI workflows tailored to your business processes, risk profile, and compliance requirements.

⸻

Section: “How It Works”

Use a 4-step layout:
	1.	Discovery
	•	Identify a high-value, repetitive workflow and success metrics.
	2.	Design
	•	Define workflow steps, data sources, guardrails, and integrations.
	3.	Build & Integrate
	•	Implement automations connected to your tools (CRM, email, forms, calendar, ticketing).
	4.	Validate & Support
	•	QA testing, monitoring, improvements, and ongoing optimization.

4) DIFFERENTIATION (make sure this is true in the page structure)

Do NOT change these pages, but ensure this new page feels distinct:
	•	AI Chat Assistant Services = website chat, lead capture, appointment booking, 24/7 assistant
	•	Custom AI Solutions = broader custom builds (agents, apps, analytics, knowledge automation)
	•	AI Workflow Automation (new) = specific workflows + integrations + reliability/guardrails

If any navigation needs updating, add “AI Workflow Automation” under Services in the menu.

⸻

5) NO PRICING ON PUBLIC PAGES

Do not display price on homepage or the new page. If we want pricing later, we’ll add it after lead volume starts.

⸻

6) IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
	•	Keep the layout consistent with current site components.
	•	Make sure the new route works on refresh (proper routing).
	•	Ensure “Learn More” button from homepage points to the new page.
